## WeatherApp App with Jetpack Compose and Repository Design Pattern üöÄ

An Android app built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, using the awesome Repository design pattern ü§ò. 

We are taking current location with FUSED LOCATION PROVIDER, from that we grab weather data from WEB API via Retrofit2 than storing it on ROOM DB, 
and if location request failed we retrieve from DB.
